1. Hello Héber, how you doing?
Hello Abiqueila, I'm fine and you?

2. Please, tell me about yourself.
Well, I'm Héber, I'm thirty nine years old. I am married with two kids. 
I am a Senior Software Engineer with seven years of experience in software development and process automation. I am an expert in RPA (Robotic Process Automation). In recent years, I have developed and participated in the development of over 60 robots for different areas of our clients' companies, but I have also developed applications, web applications, websites, internal systems, and integrations between platforms such as ERPs and CRMs. I am currently responsible for monitoring, adjusting, and improving RPAs and developing new projects.
But I participate in many meetings with clients to identify processes that can be automated and to provide support to users because I have good communication skills. I can communicate effectively with clients and users, even during stressful situations, such as system failures or bugs. I also participate a lot in training and knowledge transfer, presentations, and demonstrations. Training for new developers who join the company. So there are many responsibilities, you have to know how to delegate, know how to prioritize tasks to be able to deliver the demands we receive.

3. Why are you interested in this job?

Because this is a really good company and I'm lookin for a place to grow as a professional.

4. What are your strengths and weaknesses?
I am a hard-working, creative and focused person. Sometimes I can be a little insecure, and I also sometimes get attached to details due to perfectionism, but I have become aware and am improving.

5. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

In 5 years... I see myself still working in this company, but in a differente position, maybe as a manager, or something.

6. Why did you leav your last job?
It was a good company, but it is a small company. I am looking for a company that has space and allows me to grow professionally.

7. Why should we hire you?
Well, I'm a result-oriented person, if you give me a task I'm gonna do it, beautifully. I'm sure I will be a great addition to the team.

8. Do you have any questions for me?
