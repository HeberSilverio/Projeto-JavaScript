
1. Can you walk me through your professional experience and how it has prepared you for this role abroad?

I feel prepared because I have been challenged in many ways... in my professional career.
I am a Senior Software Developer with six years of experience... having performed tasks of medium and high complexity.
I am proactive... and highly productive.

In different projects, I have been responsible for monitoring applications... fixing bugs... implementing improvements... and supporting users... because I have good communication skills.
I can communicate effectively with clients and users... even during stressful situations... like system failures or bugs.

I have the ability to quickly identify problems... propose efficient solutions... and, as a result, bring significant value to the company.
I work daily with critical RPA (robots)... that handle orders worth millions of dollars... and make hundreds of payments per day.
When these systems fail... every minute of downtime can cause significant financial losses.

Thanks to my expertise... I know how to ask the right questions... to diagnose the problem... and implement a solution as quickly as possible.
This ensures the smooth operation of critical systems... and delivers direct financial value to the company.

2. How do you stay updated with the latest developments in technology? (describe step by step)

To stay updated with new technologies... I follow a weekly study schedule... where I constantly improve my skills... and follow roadmaps for learning.
Additionally, I enjoy attending events and conferences... as they are excellent opportunities... to learn about new technologies and trends.

This year, I attended the 5th edition of the RPA & AI Congress... as well as the RPA & AI Expo and Digital Expo... where I joined presentations... explored new products... and learned about technologies... that can solve real-world problems.
During the first months of the year... I even developed the Recognition App... with the goal of launching it... at one of these events.

After these events... I usually add the new tools and technologies I discover... to my weekly study schedule... ensuring I keep learning... and growing professionally.

3. Describe a challenging project you have worked on. What was your role, and how did you overcome the challenges?

One of the most challenging projects I worked on... was the Recognition App... an Intelligent Document Processing platform... that uses Artificial Intelligence... to extract and process data from documents.
The main challenge was the tight deadline... as the company aimed to launch the app... at a technology expo in April... but we only started development in January.

To overcome this challenge... we focused on delivering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)... prioritizing key functionalities... while placing some features in the backlog... for future sprints.
This approach allowed us to deliver a working first version of the app on time... enabling participants at the expo to test it... and experience its potential.

4. Have you ever encountered a significant conflict with a colleague or team? How did you handle it?

Yes, I have faced a significant conflict with colleagues... regarding a technical issue.
We were dealing with a situation... where the RPAs were not being executed within the expected time... which led to user complaints.
Upon investigation... we identified that one of the RPAs was freezing... due to a disconnection in the environment... holding up the queue... and blocking the execution of other processes.

At that point... the IT coordinator was unwilling to address the root cause... and insisted that the problem was with the RPA... supporting the users’ complaints.
This created a challenging situation for me... as the RPA developer.
To handle it... I applied the Socratic method... asking insightful questions... that helped gather concrete evidence... showing that the issue was related to the environment... not the RPA.

Despite the conflict... I maintained a mature attitude... taking ownership of the situation... and emphasizing that we were a team... working together to resolve the problem.
This approach helped calm the users... improve communication... and ultimately led to a collaborative resolution of the issue.

5. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

In five years... I see myself more refined... and excelling at what I already do today.
I aim to be in a leadership position... or working as a Tech Lead... where I can manage and delegate tasks... contributing my knowledge and experience... to help the team achieve the best results.

Additionally... as I have strong communication skills... and a passion for teaching... I want to continue mentoring interns and junior developers... helping them grow professionally.
I truly enjoy teaching... because I believe that sharing knowledge strengthens the team as a whole... and contributes to the company’s success.
