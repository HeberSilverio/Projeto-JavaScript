Como responder as oportunidades.

Dear Sibi,

I hope you're doing well.

I would like to share with you that I am currently involved in some significant projects within the company I work for. I believe these projects will have a very positive impact on my professional development and will contribute substantially to the growth of my career.

These projects are expected to be delivered within the next 4 to 6 months. Upon completion, I will be reassessing my career path and considering new opportunities.

If any positions arise that align with my profile and are of interest, I would greatly appreciate it if you could reach out to me during this time. I am open to new opportunities and would like to keep the line of communication open to explore potential opportunities in the future.

Thank you for your understanding and attention. I am available for any further information you may need.

Sincerely,
Jonathan Denis Rufino da Costa

Thank you so much for your message,(name)! I appreciate your time to offer me this chance, but unfortunately I will have to deny this time due to other projects that I am working on at the moment. I would love to hear more about new opportunities in the near future. Have a great day!
